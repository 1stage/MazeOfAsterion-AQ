Be sure to put the ORG $C000 directive at the top of the ASM file.

===================

Be sure to add the INC files at the top of the ASM file.

===================

To convert all hexadecimal values in the "00h" format to C-style "0x00" using VS Code search and replace:

- Open the search (Ctrl+F) or search and replace (Ctrl+H).
- Enable "Use Regular Expression" (the .* button).
- Use this regex for search: \b([0-9A-Fa-f]{2,})h\b
- Use this for replace: $$$1
- This will change 12h to 0x12, FFh to 0xFF, etc.

===================

To find all addresses $c000 to $ffff, RegEx \$[c-fC-F][0-9a-fA-F]{3}
