; Maze of Asterion Grpahics Draw Routine -
;   The routine that draws character-based graphics in Maze of Asterion is labelled GFX_DRAW .
;   -   Register B expects the FG/BG color value 
;   -   Register HL expects the CHRRAM screen address to start drawing
;       - Indexed starting points for ITEMS and MONSTERS within the VIEWPORT
;       - Indexed starting points for LEFT and RIGHT hands and inventory items
;       - Any other indexed locations (always starting in CHRRAM!!!)
;   -   Register DE expects the GFX start address (typically through the GFX_POINTERS table)
;   A graphic in Maze of Asterion is a block of AQUASCII characters, $FF terminated, with six defined “control” characters:
;   -   $00 = empty character (move right one column, NOT a space character!)
;   -   $01 = return character (move down and back to index)
;   -   $02 = backspace character (move left one column)
;   -   $03 = linefeed (move down one row)
;   -   $04 = previous line (move up one row)
;   -   $A0 = reverse colors (swap FG/BG)



; NO_GFX is a label used for an "empty" graphic, since it's only character is the end of graphic code, $FF
NO_GFX:
    db          $FF

; ITEMS:
;   - Items range from OBJECT INDEX $00 to $77, and OBJECT TYPE $00 to $1D
;   - OBJECT TYPE is the OBJECT INDEX bit-shifted RIGHT two times to remove the 2 bits of object level
;   - Items (if visible in the maze) have three sizes, depending on how far away they are from the PLAYER's position:
;       - Tiny (i.e. MAP_T): These items are either two spaces forward, or one space diagonal right or left forward from the player. These graphics are usually only a single character wide.
;       - Small (i.e. MAP_S): These items are one space forward from the player. These graphics are usually 2x2 characters in size.
;       - Regular (i.e. MAP): These items are in the same space as the player. These graphics are usually 4x4 characters in size, and this is the size used for items in the player's inventory pack.
